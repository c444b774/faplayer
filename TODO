Now it looks like a player and it plays well(?).
But there is still a lot of things to be done.

1. Play/Pause button looks strage.
2. Time(and more) is not updated when click next/prev button(My buggy interface module?).
3. Solve libass sigmentation fault(Looks like font issue.).
4. Try to use pixman instead of current scretch2 function for performance(Looks only a little.).
5. Compare yuv2rgb by theorarm and libswscale performance. (Is there a better one?)
6. Make it more user friendly.
7. Implement danmaku player(acfun.cn/bilibili.us/ichiba.cc and more).
8. Implement crawler for the sites above(How to merge flv/hlv?).
9. More work on video decode and video output, the goal is drop less and output more.
10. Take a look at audio filter/mixer/output and see its performance.
11. Implement simple video mode control(center/full/fit to screen).
